Twitter Sentiment Analysis Web App
This project is a web application for performing sentiment analysis on tweets using a trained text classification model. The app is built with Python and leverages Machine Learning, LSTM, Bidirectional Learning, and NLP tools to classify sentiments as positive, negative, or neutral.

üìÇ Project Structure
Here's an overview of the files in the repository:

app1.py - The main application script that runs the web app using a web framework (e.g., Flask or Streamlit).
performing-twitter-sentiment-analysis1.jpg - An image demonstrating the sentiment analysis process or used in the app UI.
preprocess_text.pkl - A serialized Python object used for text preprocessing (e.g., tokenization, stopword removal).
preprocessing_info.json - A JSON file containing configuration details or metadata for preprocessing.
test_tweets.csv - A CSV file containing sample tweets for testing the sentiment analysis model.
tweets_test.xlsx - An Excel file containing additional test data for sentiment analysis.
External File:

text_classification_model.h5 - A trained Keras model for text classification (stored on Google Drive due to size constraints).
üîß Skills and Technologies Used
The project incorporates the following skills and technologies:

Python - Core programming language for the project.
Machine Learning - Used to train and evaluate the sentiment analysis model.
LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) - A type of recurrent neural network (RNN) used for text classification.
Bidirectional Learning - Enhances the model‚Äôs ability to understand text by reading it in both directions (forward and backward).
NLP (Natural Language Processing) - Used for text preprocessing and sentiment analysis.
NLP Tools:
Tokenization - Splits text into words or tokens.
Stopword Removal - Removes common words (e.g., "the", "is") to focus on meaningful words.
Text Cleaning - Cleans the input text (removing special characters, converting to lowercase, etc.).
üõ† Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
cd your-repo-name
Install the required Python packages:

üöÄ How to Run the App
Ensure the model file (text_classification_model.h5) is in the project directory.

Run the application using Python:

bash
Copy
Edit
python app1.py
Open the web browser and navigate to http://localhost:5000 (or the provided local server URL).

Enter a tweet in the input field and click the "Analyze" button to see the sentiment classification.

üìä Data
test_tweets.csv - Sample tweets for testing the app.
tweets_test.xlsx - Additional test data in Excel format.
üß† Model and Preprocessing
The text_classification_model.h5 is a deep learning model trained for text sentiment classification. The model uses the preprocess_text.pkl file for consistent preprocessing (tokenization, cleaning, etc.) of new input data before classification.

üí° Usage Example
Run the app.
Enter a tweet like:
"I love using this new sentiment analysis tool!"
The app will classify the tweet as Positive, Negative, or Neutral.

üöÄ Future Enhancements
Add support for multi-language sentiment analysis.
Enhance the model‚Äôs accuracy by training on a larger dataset.
Provide batch processing for sentiment analysis of multiple tweets at once.
